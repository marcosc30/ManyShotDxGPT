"['Neonatal Marfan syndrome', 'Marfan syndrome']","1. Congestive heart failure: Cardiomegaly, dyspnea, exercise intolerance, increased NT-proBNP, and possible ascites suggest volume overload and reduced cardiac output. Peripheral edema is another common symptom that was not reported.

2. Viral myocarditis: The combination of myocarditis and cardiomegaly in a dyspneic patient raises concern for inflammation and damage to the heart muscle, most commonly due to a viral infection. Fever and chest pain may also be present.

3. Dilated cardiomyopathy: This condition causes an enlarged, weakened heart that cannot pump efficiently, leading to symptoms of heart failure like dyspnea and exercise intolerance. An ECG may show arrhythmias.

4. Cor pulmonale: Severe lung disease can cause pulmonary hypertension, leading to right-sided heart failure. While cardiomegaly and heart failure symptoms fit, lung disease symptoms (e.g., cough, hypoxia) are lacking.

4. Paroxysmal atrial tachycardia: Another potential cause of the palpitations and syncope, though ventricular arrhythmias seem more likely given the PVCs and ventricular dysfunction.

5. Tricuspid regurgitation due to right ventricular dilatation: The abnormal tricuspid valve morphology and right ventricular enlargement make this valvular issue probable. Likely a consequence of the right heart failure rather than a primary problem.",Neuromuscular diseases
['Desminopathy'],"1. Dilated cardiomyopathy: Consistent with cardiomegaly, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, mitral regurgitation, and arrhythmias. Right ventricular dilatation and tricuspid regurgitation suggest more advanced disease.

Dilated cardiomyopathy: The patient's left ventricular systolic dysfunction, atrial enlargement, and signs of right heart failure (pedal edema, hepatic congestion causing GI symptoms) fit with this diagnosis. The valvular abnormalities and conduction disturbance (RBBB) can also be seen. Key missing symptom is a history of viral illness or toxic exposure.

2. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC): This could explain the right atrial and ventricular enlargement, tricuspid valve abnormalities, and atrial fibrillation. The patient's young age also fits. However, the left-sided findings (LV dysfunction, LA enlargement) are atypical and other systemic symptoms are not usually seen in ARVC.

3. Restrictive cardiomyopathy: The bi-atrial enlargement and diastolic dysfunction suggested by the high filling pressures (NT-proBNP) could indicate a restrictive pathology. Tricuspid regurgitation and right heart failure symptoms may be secondary to this. Arguing against this is the LV systolic dysfunction which is more consistent with a dilated phenotype.

4. Connective tissue disorder (e.g. Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome): The vascular tortuosity and valvular abnormalities raise suspicion for an underlying connective tissue disease. These disorders can affect multiple organ systems which would explain the constellation of cardiac, vascular, and GI symptoms. Missing features include skeletal abnormalities and skin/joint hypermobility.

4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia: May explain the urinary hesitancy and dysuria in an older male patient. Commonly co-occurs with hypertension and heart disease. Prostate exam and post-void residual would help confirm.

5. Cirrhosis with portal hypertension: The conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and increased total bilirubin raise concern for possible cirrhosis, which could also contribute to the edema, thrombosis, and cardiomyopathy. Spider angiomata, palmar erythema, ascites, and asterixis would support this diagnosis if present. Liver function tests and imaging are needed.",Rare kidney diseases
[],"1. Advanced heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: Explains the structural heart abnormalities, pulmonary hypertension, atrial fibrillation, fluid overload symptoms, and elevated BNP. Key missing symptom is orthopnea.

2. Cirrhosis: Accounts for the liver enlargement, ascites, edema, and elevated bilirubin. However, the degree of cardiovascular dysfunction is more than would be expected from cirrhosis alone.

3. Hemochromatosis: Iron overload could cause liver dysfunction, cardiomyopathy, and endocrine abnormalities. Missing symptoms include skin hyperpigmentation, diabetes, and joint pain.

Myasthenia gravis: The patient's fatigable weakness, ptosis, specific pattern of weakness (proximal and cranial muscles affected), EMG decrement, and response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are all highly consistent with this autoimmune neuromuscular junction disorder. Anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies are likely to be positive.

2. Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome: While this presynaptic neuromuscular junction disorder can cause fatigable weakness, the cranial muscle involvement (ptosis) and EMG findings are more suggestive of myasthenia gravis. Reflexes are often decreased in Lambert-Eaton syndrome, which was not noted here.

3. Congenital myasthenic syndrome: This rare inherited neuromuscular junction disorder can mimic myasthenia gravis. However, the patient's age and lack of mention of lifelong symptoms make this less likely. Genetic testing would be needed to detect this.

4. Ocular myasthenia gravis: This variant of myasthenia gravis selectively affects the extraocular muscles and eyelid levators. However, the patient has additional limb weakness, so more generalized myasthenia gravis is more likely.

The EMG findings also support this diagnosis.

+2: Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS): While the patient has some features that could fit with LEMS like limb weakness and autonomic symptoms, the prominent ocular and bulbar involvement makes this less likely than myasthenia gravis. LEMS also classically causes a facilitating response on repetitive nerve stimulation, rather than the decremental response seen here.

+3: Botulism: The patient's ocular symptoms, bulbar weakness and respiratory muscle involvement could potentially fit with botulism. However, botulism would not typically cause fatigable weakness or the EMG findings described. The patient also lacks autonomic symptoms like dry mouth or constipation.

+4: Brainstem lesion (e.g. stroke, tumor): A brainstem lesion could explain the patient's eye movement abnormalities, dysphagia and respiratory issues.

2. Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome: This presynaptic neuromuscular junction disorder can cause ptosis, diplopia, dysarthria, and limb weakness similar to myasthenia gravis. However, reflexes are typically decreased (as seen in this patient) and symptoms improve less dramatically with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. An associated malignancy would be a red flag.

3. Multiple sclerosis: The patient's diplopia, dysarthria, gait difficulty, and limb weakness could be explained by this CNS demyelinating disease, especially in the context of abnormal cerebral white matter. However, MS would not account for the ptosis or positive myasthenia antibodies. Oligoclonal bands in the CSF would support this diagnosis.

2. Gitelman syndrome: Similar to Bartter syndrome with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, increased renin. Hypocalciuria would be expected rather than hypercalciuria. Also does not explain liver findings or oral ulcer.

3. Hyperaldosteronism: Primary hyperaldosteronism could lead to hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, muscle weakness, increased renin. However, would expect hypertension and metabolic alkalosis which were not reported. Does not readily explain neurological symptoms, liver hyperplasia or oral ulcer.

4. Celiac disease: Could account for diarrhea, electrolyte losses, liver hyperplasia, oral ulcers from malnutrition. Vitamin deficiencies could contribute to neurological symptoms. Does not directly explain cardiac findings.

5. Autoimmune condition such as Sjogren's syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus: Could present with oral ulcers, diarrhea, liver abnormalities, neurological symptoms. Renal involvement could lead to electrolyte disturbances. Anemia and inflammatory markers would support this. Does not classically cause nodular liver hyperplasia.",Rare kidney diseases
['Gitelman syndrome'],"1. Gitelman syndrome: Characterized by hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, hypocalciuria, and hypomagnesemia (not reported in this case). Caused by mutations affecting the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule.

2. Bartter syndrome: Presents with hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and hypercalciuria (in contrast to the hypocalciuria seen in this patient). Caused by mutations affecting transporters in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle.

3. Diuretic use: Certain diuretics (e.g., thiazides, loop diuretics) can cause hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and altered urinary electrolyte excretion. The patient's medication history would be relevant.

4. Genetic mineralocorticoid excess states (e.g., Liddle syndrome, apparent mineralocorticoid excess): Can cause hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis due to increased renal sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. Hypocalciuria is not typically seen.

5. Acquired mineralocorticoid excess (e.g., primary hyperaldosteronism): Excess aldosterone can lead to hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and increased urinary potassium excretion. Hypocalciuria is not a classic feature. Additional testing (e.g., aldosterone, renin levels) would be helpful.",Rare kidney diseases
['Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria'],"1+ Aplastic anemia: Pancytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and megaloblastic anemia are hallmark features. Liver and kidney abnormalities can occur secondarily. Bone marrow biopsy would be diagnostic.

2+ Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): Multisystem autoimmune disease that can cause pancytopenia, liver inflammation, glomerulonephritis (proteinuria, hematuria), urticaria, and hypercoagulability. Positive ANA and anti-dsDNA antibodies would support the diagnosis.

3+ Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH): Acquired stem cell disorder leading to pancytopenia, hemolysis (elevated unconjugated bilirubin), hypercoagulability, and sometimes kidney dysfunction. Flow cytometry would show absence of GPI-linked proteins on blood cells.

4+ Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS): Bone marrow disorder causing ineffective hematopoiesis and peripheral cytopenias, potentially affecting all cell lines. May explain abnormal cell morphology. Diagnosis requires bone marrow biopsy and cytogenetic studies.

5+ Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency: Can cause megaloblastic anemia, pancytopenia, hyperbilirubinemia, and neurologic symptoms like muscle weakness or vertigo. Diarrhea may lead to malabsorption.

2. Acute myeloid leukemia: Pancytopenia, myelodysplasia, abnormal cell morphologies, fever. Presence of circulating blasts on peripheral smear would support this diagnosis.

3. Aplastic anemia: Pancytopenia with hypocellular bone marrow. Reticulocytosis less likely in this condition compared to MDS or AML. 

4. Systemic lupus erythematosus: Pancytopenia, oral ulcers, skin rash, fever. May have additional symptoms like arthritis and serositis. Positive ANA and dsDNA would support diagnosis.

5. Viral suppression of bone marrow (e.g., HIV, EBV, CMV): Pancytopenia, fever, oral ulcers. Recurrent infections may be more prominent. Viral serologies can confirm diagnosis.",Rare haematological diseases
['Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria'],"1. Myeloproliferative neoplasm with secondary myelofibrosis: The patient's anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, abnormal blood cell morphology, and hemophagocytosis are consistent with a myeloproliferative disorder. Hepatomegaly, portal vein thrombosis, and hypercoagulability are known complications. However, the skin findings and autoimmune-type symptoms are less typical.

2. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): DIC can present with purpura, thrombocytopenia, anemia, hypercoagulability, and bleeding manifestations like gastric varices. It is often secondary to sepsis, malignancy, or liver disease. Additional findings that would support this diagnosis include prolonged PT/PTT and decreased fibrinogen.

3. Autoimmune disorder with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome: Systemic lupus erythematosus or another connective tissue disease could explain the patient's rash, cytopenia, fever, and multiorgan involvement. Antiphospholipid antibodies can cause arterial and venous thromboses. Specific antibody testing would be helpful.

4. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH): The patient exhibits many features of HLH, including fever, cytopenia, hepatomegaly, and hemophagocytosis on bone marrow exam. HLH is often triggered by infection or malignancy and leads to severe systemic inflammation. Elevated ferritin and low NK cell activity are additional diagnostic clues not mentioned.

5. Acute leukemia with complications: Acute myeloid or lymphoblastic leukemia can present with pancytopenia, fatigue, fever, and leukocytosis due to blast cells. The other manifestations like hepatomegaly, coagulopathy, and infection may represent leukostasis or secondary complications of the malignancy. However, one would expect a more significant elevation in the white blood cell count.",Rare haematological diseases
['POEMS syndrome'],"1. Ovarian cancer with metastatic spread: The ovarian cyst, teratoma, and enlarged ovaries, in the setting of ascites, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and constitutional symptoms like weight loss and fever are suspicious for an ovarian malignancy with intraabdominal metastases. The pulmonary findings and pericardial effusion could represent further metastatic spread. Key symptoms not reported include abdominal pain and early satiety.

2. Decompensated cirrhosis: Hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, portal hypertension (suggested by abnormal vena cava), hypoalbuminemia, and thrombocytosis (if due to splenic sequestration) fit with end-stage liver disease. The kidney dysfunction could be hepatorenal syndrome. Varices and hepatic encephalopathy are not reported.

3. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): SLE can cause multi-organ dysfunction including glomerulonephritis (proteinuria, hematuria), serositis (pleural and pericardial effusions), anemia, thrombocytosis, and elevated inflammatory markers. The abnormal skin pigmentation could be a butterfly rash. Antinuclear antibody testing would be helpful. Joint pain and photosensitivity are not mentioned.

4. Congestive heart failure (CHF) with secondary effects: Severe CHF can explain the cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, hepatic congestion, and fluid overload (anasarca, ascites). The kidney and liver abnormalities may be due to cardiorenal syndrome and cardiac cirrhosis respectively. Typical CHF symptoms like dyspnea and orthopnea are lacking.

5. Tuberculosis: Disseminated TB could account for the constitutional symptoms, lymphadenopathy, pulmonary and pleural findings, pericardial effusion, hepatosplenomegaly, and ascites. Testing for HIV as a risk factor and acid-fast bacilli staining would be warranted. Night sweats and chronic cough are not described.",Rare neurological diseases
['POEMS syndrome'],"1. Decompensated cirrhosis: Explains the edema, ascites, splenomegaly, and hepatic dysfunction. Does not fully account for the endocrine abnormalities, neuropathy, or hematologic changes.

2. Hypothyroidism: Consistent with the abnormal thyroid labs, edema, psychiatric changes, and possibly the neuropathy and muscle weakness. However, it would not typically cause such extensive fluid overload or the hematologic findings.  

3. Hematologic malignancy (e.g., lymphoma, multiple myeloma): The monoclonal IgG spike, anemia, lymphadenopathy, fever, and splenomegaly raise suspicion for an underlying blood cancer. This could potentially tie together many of the multisystem issues, although the endocrine and neurologic symptoms are less typical.

4. POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein, skin changes): A rare paraneoplastic syndrome that could unify the neuropathy, splenomegaly, hypothyroidism, hyperpigmentation, monoclonal protein, and edema. However, some typical features like sclerotic bone lesions were not mentioned.

2. Paraneoplastic neurological syndrome: The widespread neurological symptoms along with thrombocytosis, increased IgA, and abnormal granulocytopoiesis raise concern for an underlying malignancy triggering an autoimmune neurological disorder. The cardiovascular findings could be coincidental or related.

3. POEMS syndrome (Polyneuropathy, Organomegaly, Endocrinopathy, Monoclonal protein, Skin changes): The combination of polyneuropathy, splenomegaly, thrombocytosis, increased IgA, and osteoporosis fits this rare multisystem disorder. However, the patient is missing key features like endocrinopathy and skin changes.

4. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP): The motor and sensory neuropathy, lower limb weakness, and abnormal nerve morphology are consistent with CIDP. However, this diagnosis would not explain the papilledema, cardiovascular findings, organomegaly, or hematologic abnormalities.

5. Amyloidosis: The multiorgan involvement including neuropathy, cardiomyopathy (ventricular and atrial abnormalities), hepatic infiltration, and splenomegaly could be explained by systemic amyloidosis. The thrombocytosis and increased IgA might reflect an underlying plasma cell dyscrasia. However, papilledema would be unusual.",Rare neurological diseases

['POEMS syndrome'],"1. Amyloidosis: Explains the multisystem involvement including cardiac (valve abnormality, effusion), renal (nephrolithiasis, hematuria, elevated creatinine), possible GI (chronic gastritis/colitis) and musculoskeletal (bone density abnormality) manifestations. The monoclonal IgA could be a clue to AL amyloidosis. Key symptoms not mentioned include peripheral neuropathy and macroglossia.

2. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): The constellation of facial edema, serositis (pleural and pericardial effusions), renal disease, and hematologic abnormalities could fit with SLE. Additional symptoms that would support this include arthritis, photosensitivity, and neuropsychiatric manifestations.

3. Lymphoma: The lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, abnormal lymphocyte morphology, and monoclonal IgA raise concern for lymphoma. The systemic symptoms and fluid retention could be secondary to lymphomatous infiltration or cytokine release. Night sweats and rapidly enlarging lymph nodes would further support this diagnosis.

4. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The cardiomegaly, valve abnormality, fluid retention, and exertional symptoms are all consistent with CHF. However, this would not readily explain the hematologic findings, hypothyroidism, or multisystem involvement.

5. Sarcoidosis: A multisystem granulomatous disorder that can involve the heart, lungs, skin, and lymph nodes.
