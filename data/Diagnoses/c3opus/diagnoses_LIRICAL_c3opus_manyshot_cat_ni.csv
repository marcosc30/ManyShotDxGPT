['Muckle-Wells syndrome'],"1. Behçet disease: The patient's conjunctivitis, urticaria, headache, and elevated inflammatory markers fit well with this diagnosis. Other symptoms of Behçet's that are not reported here but would support the diagnosis if present include oral/genital ulcers and arthritis.

2. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA): The presence of vasculitis, elevated inflammatory markers, and neutrophilia could indicate GPA. Involvement of the sinuses, lungs, and kidneys is common in GPA but is not noted in this patient.

3. CNS vasculitis: The neurological symptoms along with evidence of systemic vasculitis and inflammation raise concern for a CNS vasculitis. An MRI brain and CNS angiogram would be helpful to evaluate for this.

4. Sarcoidosis: Ocular involvement, increased intracranial pressure, and systemic inflammation can be seen in sarcoidosis. Chest imaging and tissue biopsy looking for non-caseating granulomas could help diagnose this.

5. Hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis syndrome (HUVS): The combination of urticaria and vasculitis with systemic inflammation makes HUVS a possibility, though the lack of reported kidney and lung involvement makes this less likely than the diagnoses above.",Autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases

4. Niemann-Pick disease type C: This lipid storage disorder can cause ataxia, intellectual decline, and hepatosplenomegaly. The lack of vertical supranuclear gaze palsy and other characteristic neurological signs makes this diagnosis less probable.

5. Aminoacidopathy (e.g., phenylketonuria, maple syrup urine disease): The patient's intellectual disability, short stature, and aminoaciduria raise the possibility of an amino acid metabolism disorder. However, these conditions typically present early in life with severe symptoms like seizures, encephalopathy, and failure to thrive, which are not described in this case.",Hereditary metabolic disorders

The seizures, microcephaly, and developmental regression are also consistent. However, lactic acidosis and other systemic features are not mentioned.

2. Urea cycle disorder: The hyperammonemia, neurological symptoms, and regression raise the possibility of a urea cycle defect. Seizures and intellectual disability can result from the toxic effects of ammonia on the brain. However, the muscle involvement and arrhythmia are not typical.

[],"1+ Long QT syndrome: The prolonged QTc interval, polymorphic VT (possibly torsades de pointes), and ventricular fibrillation fit this diagnosis. A triggering factor like myocarditis may have unmasked the condition.

2+ Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT): The polymorphic VT and ventricular fibrillation, especially if provoked by exertion or stress, would be consistent with CPVT. The prolonged QTc is less typical.

3+ Brugada syndrome: The polymorphic VT and ventricular fibrillation could fit Brugada syndrome, especially if there are ST segment elevations in V1-V3 on ECG. Prolonged QTc is not a typical feature.

4+ Myocarditis: The myocarditis could be the primary issue causing the ventricular arrhythmias and fibrillation. However, the prolonged QTc suggests there may be an underlying inherited arrhythmia syndrome as well.

5+ Drug-induced QT prolongation: If the patient is taking any QT-prolonging medications, this could explain the prolonged QTc and polymorphic VT. The ventricular fibrillation suggests a more severe reaction than usual.",Uncommon and rare diseases of the heart

['Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A'],"1. Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2 (MEN2): Pheochromocytoma, elevated calcitonin suggestive of medullary thyroid cancer, and thyroid nodule are all highly consistent with MEN2. Hyperparathyroidism is another feature of MEN2 that should be screened for.

2. Sporadic pheochromocytoma: The adrenal tumor could be a sporadic pheochromocytoma. However, the thyroid findings make a genetic syndrome more likely.

3. Medullary thyroid cancer (sporadic): Elevated calcitonin and a thyroid nodule suggest medullary thyroid cancer, but a sporadic case would not explain the concomitant pheochromocytoma.  

4. Von Hippel-Lindau disease: Can present with pheochromocytomas, but the lack of other classic features like hemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinoma, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors makes it less probable.

5. Neurofibromatosis type 1: Pheochromocytomas can occur but are less common than in MEN2. The absence of neurofibromas, café-au-lait macules and other characteristic findings reduces the likelihood of this diagnosis.",Rare genetic tumour risk syndromes

3. Hypophosphatasia: The tooth and bone abnormalities could be seen in this condition, though the specific facial features are less characteristic. Low serum alkaline phosphatase and increased urinary phosphoethanolamine would support this diagnosis.  

4. Osteogenesis imperfecta: Some forms can have wormian bones and tooth abnormalities. However, this diagnosis is less likely without a history of fractures, blue sclerae, or hearing loss. Genetic testing would be helpful.

5. Congenital myopathy (e.g., central core disease, nemaline myopathy): These disorders cause muscle weakness, often from birth or early childhood. Hyporeflexia and elevated CK can be seen. Myotonia and generalized hypertrophy are not typical. Specific diagnosis requires genetic testing or muscle biopsy with characteristic histologic findings.",Neuromuscular diseases

It is associated with lactic acidosis, myopathy with ragged-red fibers and COX-negative fibers, and sensorineural hearing loss, all present in this patient. Genetic testing of the various COX subunits would be indicated.

4. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS): While this patient is young for stroke-like episodes, MELAS can present in infancy with failure to thrive, lactic acidosis, myopathy, and hearing loss. Genetic testing for the common m.3243A>G mutation and other mtDNA variants would be recommended.

5. Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF): Onset is often in childhood or adolescence, but infants can present with hypotonia, failure to thrive, hearing loss, and lactic acidosis.
