3. Mixed connective tissue disease: The multi-system involvement (muscles, liver, kidneys) and positive ANA raise suspicion for this overlap syndrome. Additional antibody testing (e.g., anti-U1 RNP) would be helpful. The patient does not mention other common symptoms like Raynaud's, arthritis, or pulmonary hypertension.

4. Autoimmune hepatitis: The liver enzyme abnormalities, positive ANA, and antimitochondrial antibodies support an autoimmune liver process. A liver biopsy would help confirm the diagnosis. The muscle and kidney issues could be separate or related autoimmune conditions.

5. Cardiac amyloidosis: While less likely, the combination of heart failure signs (abnormal EKG, elevated NT-proBNP), kidney dysfunction, and liver abnormalities could represent a systemic infiltrative disorder like amyloidosis. The paraparesis and necrotizing myopathy would be atypical, though.",Rare hepatological diseases

['Immunoglobulin A vasculitis'],"1. ANCA-associated vasculitis (e.g., granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis): Consistent with recurrent UTIs, purpura, fever, leukocytosis, vasculitis, and lower extremity pain/edema. ANCA antibodies would support this diagnosis.

2. IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein purpura): Presents with purpura (typically in dependent areas), arthralgia/arthritis, abdominal pain, and sometimes nephritis which could lead to recurrent UTIs. Most common in children but can occur in adults. Lacks fever/leukocytosis.

3. Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis: Can cause purpura, arthralgia, weakness, and kidney inflammation leading to recurrent UTIs. Often secondary to viral infections like hepatitis C or autoimmune conditions like Sjögren's. Additional symptoms may include neuropathy and liver involvement.

4. Polyarteritis nodosa: Medium-vessel vasculitis that can cause purpura, fever, weight loss, hypertension, abdominal pain, and neuropathy. Kidney involvement could lead to recurrent UTIs. Lacks leukocytosis and groin pain.

5. Lupus erythematosus with vasculitis: Multisystem autoimmune disease that can cause fever, kidney inflammation (leading to UTIs), leukocytosis, and vasculitis with purpura and extremity pain. Additional symptoms may include arthritis, serositis, and neurologic involvement. Low complement levels and anti-dsDNA antibodies support diagnosis.",Autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases
