['Wilson disease'],"1. Wilson disease: Kayser-Fleischer rings, cirrhosis, jaundice, ascites, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, decreased ceruloplasmin. Key missing symptom is neurological involvement.

2. Autoimmune hepatitis: Cirrhosis, jaundice, elevated liver enzymes, hypoalbuminemia, prolonged prothrombin time. Does not explain Kayser-Fleischer rings or hematuria.

3. Porphyria (acute intermittent or variegate): Increased urinary porphobilinogen, abdominal pain, hypoactive bowel sounds, skin rash. Kayser-Fleischer rings would be atypical.

4. Chronic hepatitis C with cryoglobulinemia: Cirrhosis, jaundice, skin rash, hematuria, elevated liver enzymes. Kayser-Fleischer rings not expected.

5. Primary sclerosing cholangitis: Cirrhosis, jaundice, elevated alkaline phosphatase, pruritis (not mentioned). Hematuria and Kayser-Fleischer rings would be unusual.",Rare hepatological diseases
['Wilson disease'],"1. Wilson disease: The patient's irritability, personality changes, tremor, hepatomegaly, decreased ceruloplasmin, increased urinary copper, elevated liver enzymes, and Kayser-Fleischer rings are all consistent with this diagnosis. No key symptoms of Wilson disease are missing.

2. Viral hepatitis (e.g., hepatitis B or C): The patient's nausea, abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, and elevated liver enzymes could be caused by viral hepatitis. However, the neurological symptoms and Kayser-Fleischer rings are not typical of this condition.

3. Drug-induced liver injury: Certain medications can cause hepatitis and elevated liver enzymes, which could explain some of the patient's symptoms. However, the neurological findings and decreased ceruloplasmin are not consistent with this diagnosis.

4. Hemochromatosis: This genetic disorder causes iron overload, which can lead to liver damage and elevated liver enzymes. However, the patient's neurological symptoms, decreased ceruloplasmin, and Kayser-Fleischer rings are not typical of hemochromatosis.

5. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: This genetic condition can cause liver disease and elevated liver enzymes, but it would not typically cause the neurological symptoms or copper metabolism abnormalities seen in this patient.",Rare hepatological diseases
['Wilson disease'],"1. Wilson disease: Characterized by decreased ceruloplasmin, increased urinary copper, Kayser-Fleischer rings, liver abnormalities, and neurological symptoms including dysarthria, dysphagia, drooling, and tremor. Poor appetite and hematuria can also occur.

2. Menkes disease: Shares some features with Wilson disease like decreased ceruloplasmin and neurological symptoms, but onset is in infancy. Key symptoms not reported include hypopigmented or kinky hair, failure to thrive, and connective tissue abnormalities.

3. Chronic liver disease: Can cause liver abnormalities and neurological symptoms due to hepatic encephalopathy. However, specific findings like Kayser-Fleischer rings and abnormal copper studies would not be expected.

4. Neurological disorder (e.g. Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis): Could explain neurological symptoms like speech and swallowing difficulties, drooling, and tremor. However, does not account well for the liver abnormalities and specific lab findings.

5. Urinary tract infection: Hematuria could be caused by a UTI. However, this would not explain any of the other symptoms and findings.",Rare hepatological diseases
['Wilson disease'],"1. Wilson disease: The patient's neurological symptoms (muscle weakness, slurred speech, incoordination, involuntary movements), liver abnormalities, Kayser-Fleischer rings, and abnormal copper metabolism (decreased ceruloplasmin, increased urinary copper) are all consistent with this diagnosis. Wilson disease does not typically cause hyperhomocystinemia or vitamin B12 abnormalities.

2. Vitamin B12 deficiency: The patient's neurological symptoms, hyperhomocystinemia, and abnormal vitamin B12 metabolism could be explained by a severe B12 deficiency. However, this would not account for the liver abnormalities or copper metabolism disturbance.

3. Niemann-Pick disease type C: This lysosomal storage disorder can cause neurological symptoms, splenomegaly, and liver dysfunction. However, it does not typically involve copper metabolism abnormalities or cause Kayser-Fleischer rings.

4. Alcohol-related liver disease with neurological complications: Chronic alcohol use can lead to liver cirrhosis and neurological symptoms like ataxia and dysarthria. It does not fit well with this patient's young age, copper abnormalities, or Kayser-Fleischer rings.

5. Mitochondrial disorder: Mitochondrial dysfunction could cause multisystem involvement including muscle weakness, neurological abnormalities, and liver dysfunction. It would be less likely to selectively cause copper metabolism disturbance or Kayser-Fleischer rings.",Rare hepatological diseases
['Wilson disease'],"1. Wilson disease: Decreased ceruloplasmin, increased urinary copper, slurred speech, drooling, hand tremor, and hand weakness are all consistent with neurological Wilson disease. Proteinuria can result from kidney damage. Key features not reported include jaundice, Kayser-Fleischer rings, and cirrhosis.

2. Menkes disease: This is another disorder of copper metabolism that could potentially explain low ceruloplasmin and neurological symptoms. However, Menkes usually presents in infancy with developmental delay, seizures, and abnormal hair, which were not described in this patient. Urinary copper is also typically decreased, not increased.

3. Parkinson's disease: Tremor, slurred speech, drooling, and weakness could be seen in Parkinson's. However, Parkinson's would not cause abnormal ceruloplasmin and urinary copper. Additional expected symptoms include bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability.  

4. Essential tremor: Hand tremor is the key feature of essential tremor, but this would not explain the patient's other symptoms and lab findings. Essential tremor is not associated with abnormal copper metabolism, muscle weakness, or proteinuria.

5. Multiple system atrophy: This rare neurodegenerative disorder can cause parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, and autonomic dysfunction. Slurred speech, drooling, tremor, and weakness may occur. However, it would not account for low ceruloplasmin and high urinary copper. Additional features like orthostatic hypotension, urinary incontinence, and erectile dysfunction are common but were not noted here.",Rare hepatological diseases
['McCune-Albright syndrome'],"1. McCune-Albright syndrome: The patient exhibits the classic triad of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, cafe-au-lait spots, and precocious puberty. Other consistent features include the endocrine abnormalities and skeletal findings.

2. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia: While this could explain the bone pain, fractures, and fibrous dysplasia, it would not account for the precocious puberty, cafe-au-lait spots, or other symptoms.

3. Osteogenesis imperfecta: The recurrent fractures and skeletal abnormalities could fit, but osteogenesis imperfecta would not cause cafe-au-lait spots or precocious puberty. Hearing loss can sometimes be seen.

4. Neurofibromatosis type 1: Although neurofibromas were not mentioned, this disorder can be associated with cafe-au-lait spots, skeletal dysplasia, early puberty, and learning disabilities. However, the pattern of skeletal findings is not classic for NF1.

5. Idiopathic precocious puberty: While this could explain the early puberty and reproductive symptoms, it would not account for the cafe-au-lait spots or skeletal findings.",Rare bone disorders
['McCune-Albright syndrome'],"1. McCune-Albright syndrome: The patient's accelerated skeletal maturation, polyostotic and monostotic fibrous dysplasia, cafe-au-lait spots, premature thelarche, abnormal uterine bleeding, and hormonal changes (increased estradiol, decreased FSH/LH) are all consistent with this diagnosis.

2. Ovarian neoplasm: The ovarian cyst and abnormal uterine bleeding raise suspicion for a tumor, but the patient's young age and other features make this diagnosis less likely.

3. Disorder of sex development (DSD): The abnormal vaginal morphology could indicate an underlying DSD. However, more details about the anatomic findings are needed, and the other symptoms are not typical for DSDs.

4. Precocious puberty due to other causes (e.g. brain tumor): The premature thelarche, enlarged uterus, and hormonal changes suggest precocious puberty, but the skeletal findings and cafe-au-lait spots are not explained by this.

5. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (other causes): While the patient does have polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, the presence of additional findings (precocious puberty, cafe-au-lait spots) suggests McCune-Albright syndrome rather than isolated fibrous dysplasia.",Rare bone disorders
['McCune-Albright syndrome'],"1. McCune-Albright syndrome: The patient's cafe-au-lait spots, fibrous dysplasia, accelerated skeletal maturation, precocious puberty, and pituitary hormone elevations are all consistent with this diagnosis. Genetic testing for GNAS mutations could confirm.

2. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia: While the patient has fibrous dysplasia and some of the associated skeletal changes, other key features of McCune-Albright like precocious puberty are not mentioned, so isolated polyostotic fibrous dysplasia is possible.

3. Neurofibromatosis type 1: The cafe-au-lait macules are consistent with NF1, but the patient's other features like fibrous dysplasia and pituitary abnormalities are not typical of this condition. Absence of neurofibromas and Lisch nodules (if examined for) would argue against NF1.

4. Pituitary adenoma: A growth hormone and prolactin-secreting pituitary tumor could explain the patient's hormone abnormalities and accelerated growth, but would not account for the fibrous dysplasia and cafe-au-lait spots.

5. Precocious puberty due to another cause: While the patient has clear signs of early puberty, the pituitary abnormalities and skeletal changes suggest a more systemic condition than isolated precocious puberty. However, other rare causes (e.g. adrenal tumors, exogenous hormone exposure) are possible.",Rare bone disorders
['McCune-Albright syndrome'],"1. McCune-Albright syndrome: The patient's polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, cafe-au-lait macules, and skeletal abnormalities fit this diagnosis. However, classic endocrine abnormalities were not reported.

2. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1): The large, irregularly bordered cafe-au-lait macules are characteristic of NF1. The patient's other symptoms are less typical of NF1 but could be rare manifestations. 

3. Jaffe-Campanacci syndrome: This condition could explain the cafe-au-lait macules and skeletal findings, but the patient is not reported to have the classic non-ossifying fibromas or cardiovascular anomalies.

4. Segmental neurofibromatosis: If the patient's findings are limited to one body region, this localized form of NF1 is possible. More information is needed about the distribution of symptoms.

5. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (isolated): If no underlying syndrome is identified, the patient may have a case of isolated polyostotic fibrous dysplasia with some atypical additional findings.",Rare bone disorders
['McCune-Albright syndrome'],"1. McCune-Albright syndrome: The patient's precocious puberty, cafe-au-lait spots, abnormal vaginal and breast morphology, and abnormal sex hormone levels are consistent with this condition. Hyperthyroidism can also occur.

2. Neurofibromatosis type 1 with associated endocrine abnormalities: The cafe-au-lait macules with irregular margins are characteristic of NF1. While less common than in McCune-Albright syndrome, precocious puberty and hyperthyroidism can occur in NF1.

3. Idiopathic precocious puberty with coexisting hyperthyroidism: The patient has clear signs of precocious puberty with abnormal sex hormone levels and physical changes. Hyperthyroidism is present as a separate issue. However, this diagnosis does not readily explain the cafe-au-lait spots or developmental issues.

4. Juvenile hyperthyroidism with secondary precocious puberty: Severe hyperthyroidism itself can sometimes trigger early puberty. Additional symptoms like weight loss, tachycardia, and goiter would support this. The cafe-au-lait spots would likely be coincidental.

5. Endocrine disorder secondary to an underlying developmental syndrome: The combination of endocrine dysfunction, abnormal development, and cafe-au-lait spots could fit with certain rare genetic syndromes. Detailed genetic testing and evaluation by a geneticist would be recommended.",Rare endocrine conditions
"['Neonatal Marfan syndrome', 'Marfan syndrome']","1. Marfan syndrome type 1: Consistent with aortic root dilation, valve abnormalities, and potential lung involvement. Would expect to see skeletal features like tall stature, arachnodactyly, and lens dislocation that were not mentioned.

2. Loeys-Dietz syndrome: Another connective tissue disorder that can present with aortic aneurysm, arterial tortuosity, and congenital heart defects. Craniofacial features like hypertelorism and bifid uvula are often seen but were not noted here.

3. Congenital contractural arachnodactyly: Presents with aortic dilation and mitral valve prolapse, but skeletal features of arachnodactyly, camptodactyly, and crumpled ears are usually prominent.

4. Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (FTAAD): Can cause isolated aortic aneurysm and dissection without other connective tissue symptoms. Family history would be important to elicit.

5. Acquired heart disease with secondary bronchiectasis: If no signs of an underlying connective tissue disorder are found, the cardiovascular abnormalities could be acquired (e.g. from hypertension, atherosclerosis, etc.) with bronchiectasis developing secondarily from recurrent infections or inflammation. A less likely possibility given the extent of findings at a young age.",Rare connective tissue and musculoskeletal diseases
"['Neonatal Marfan syndrome', 'Marfan syndrome']","1. Marfan syndrome type 1: Kyphoscoliosis can occur along with other skeletal features like tall stature, long limbs, and joint hypermobility. Additional cardiovascular and ocular features are often present but not reported here.

2. Congenital contractural arachnodactyly: Kyphoscoliosis is a common finding, often with tall stature, long slender fingers and toes (arachnodactyly), and contracted joints. The lack of arachnodactyly and contractures makes this less likely.

3. Loeys-Dietz syndrome: Kyphoscoliosis can be seen with other skeletal abnormalities like pectus deformity, arachnodactyly, and joint hypermobility. Bifid uvula, arterial tortuosity, and hypertelorism are also characteristic but not mentioned.

4. Ehlers-Danlos syndromes: Some types can present with kyphoscoliosis along with joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility. The absence of these additional features reduces the likelihood.

5. Neuromuscular disorders: Various conditions like muscular dystrophies and spinal muscular atrophy can lead to kyphoscoliosis due to muscle weakness. However, other neurological symptoms and proximal weakness are usually evident as well.",Rare connective tissue and musculoskeletal diseases
"['Neonatal Marfan syndrome', 'Marfan syndrome']","1. Marfan syndrome: The patient's tall stature, mitral valve prolapse, aortic root aneurysm, and kyphoscoliosis are all consistent with Marfan syndrome. However, the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is less common in Marfan syndrome.

2. Loeys-Dietz syndrome: Loeys-Dietz syndrome shares many features with Marfan syndrome and could explain the patient's tall stature, valvular dysfunction, aortic root aneurysm, and skeletal abnormalities. Certain subtypes of Loeys-Dietz are associated with a higher risk of early and aggressive aortic aneurysms.

3. Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: The cardiovascular manifestations in this patient could potentially fit with vascular EDS, which is associated with valvular dysfunction and aortic root dilation. However, vascular EDS does not typically cause tall stature or kyphoscoliosis.

4. Congenital contractural arachnodactyly (Beals syndrome): This condition has substantial overlap with Marfan syndrome, including tall stature, valvular abnormalities, and aortic root dilation. However, the patient does not have the characteristic contractures or crumpled ears seen in Beals syndrome.

5. Familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (FTAAD): If no syndromic cause is identified, the patient's aortic root aneurysm could be due to non-syndromic familial TAAD. An underlying connective tissue disorder is more likely given the multi-system involvement, but FTAAD should remain on the differential.",Rare connective tissue and musculoskeletal diseases
"['Neonatal Marfan syndrome', 'Marfan syndrome']","1. Marfan syndrome type 1: Characterized by lens dislocation, high myopia, scoliosis, and other skeletal abnormalities. The patient has all of these key features.

2. Homocystinuria: Can cause lens dislocation and skeletal abnormalities like scoliosis. However, it typically does not cause high myopia, and usually presents with intellectual disability, which this patient does not have.

3. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, kyphoscoliotic type: Features scoliosis and lens dislocation, but high myopia is not a typical finding. Patients also usually have severe joint hypermobility and skin hyperextensibility.

4. Ectopia lentis et pupillae: An inherited disorder that causes lens dislocation and pupil abnormalities. However, it is not typically associated with skeletal issues like scoliosis.

5. Isolated ectopia lentis: Lens dislocation without associated systemic findings. Less likely given this patient's scoliosis and back pain.",Rare connective tissue and musculoskeletal diseases
"['Neonatal Marfan syndrome', 'Marfan syndrome']","1. Heart failure: The patient's cardiomegaly, dyspnea, exercise intolerance, and elevated NT-proBNP are all consistent with heart failure. Abdominal distention also suggests possible right-sided heart failure. Myocarditis may be the underlying cause.

2. Myocarditis: Given the evidence of myocardial inflammation, myocarditis is likely the primary diagnosis and the cause of the patient's heart failure symptoms. Viral infection is the most common etiology.

3. Dilated cardiomyopathy: The enlarged heart and heart failure symptoms could be due to dilated cardiomyopathy, which can be caused by myocarditis. However, other key features like a dilated left ventricle are not specifically mentioned.

4. Restrictive cardiomyopathy: Restrictive cardiomyopathy can cause heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, but is less likely here given the cardiomegaly. Infiltrative causes like amyloidosis or sarcoidosis are not suggested by the provided information.

5. Constrictive pericarditis: Constrictive pericarditis can cause right-sided heart failure symptoms like dyspnea, abdominal distention, and exercise intolerance. However, it typically causes a small or normal-sized heart, not cardiomegaly.",Rare connective tissue and musculoskeletal diseases
['Desminopathy'],"1. Advanced heart failure: The patient has multiple signs of heart failure including dilated cardiomyopathy, reduced systolic function, elevated pulmonary artery pressure, pedal edema, and increased NT-proBNP. Exertional dyspnea and syncope also fit. Some additional signs of advanced disease that are not reported include ascites and jaundice.

2. Valvular heart disease: The abnormal tricuspid valve morphology suggests there may be valvular dysfunction contributing to the right-sided heart failure symptoms. However, left-sided valvular disease is not mentioned.

3. Coronary artery disease: While not definitively reported, the presence of cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias raises the possibility of ischemic heart disease. Angina is a key symptom that is not mentioned though.

4. Cardiac amyloidosis: The constellation of heart failure, arrhythmias, and possible neuropathy (causing the muscle weakness) could fit with a systemic disease like amyloidosis. However, hallmark features like macroglossia and periorbital purpura are not noted.

5. Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy: The multiple arrhythmias, including paroxysmal atrial and ventricular tachycardia, could potentially be the primary issue that has led to the dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure over time. The lack of other explanatory cardiac diagnoses makes this more likely.",Neuromuscular diseases
['Desminopathy'],"1. Dilated cardiomyopathy: The cardiomegaly, ventricular dilation, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and mitral/tricuspid regurgitation are consistent with this diagnosis. The arrhythmias and conduction abnormality can also occur. Symptoms of vomiting, falls, and leg weakness could be explained by reduced cardiac output. Kidney dysfunction is a potential complication.

2. Ischemic cardiomyopathy: The regional wall motion abnormalities raise concern for possible coronary ischemia and prior infarction leading to ventricular dysfunction. ST depression and T-wave inversion on ECG are potential ischemic changes. Mitral regurgitation can occur due to papillary muscle dysfunction.

3. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC): The right ventricular dilation, ventricular arrhythmias, and right bundle branch block fit with this diagnosis. However, ARVC typically does not cause left-sided structural changes.

4. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: While the left ventricular wall motion abnormality could represent asymmetric septal hypertrophy in this condition, the ventricular dilation and systolic dysfunction are not typical features. The mitral regurgitation and arrhythmias can occur.

5. Cardiac amyloidosis: Infiltration of the myocardium can lead to ventricular wall thickening and dilation, diastolic and systolic dysfunction, valvular regurgitation, and arrhythmias. The conduction disease and kidney dysfunction could fit as well. However, low voltage on ECG is often seen, rather than the ST and T-wave changes described.",Neuromuscular diseases
['Desminopathy'],"1. Dilated cardiomyopathy: The patient has cardiomegaly, valvular abnormalities, ventricular dysfunction, heart failure symptoms, and arrhythmia which are all consistent with advanced dilated cardiomyopathy. However, the degree of liver involvement is atypical.

2. Restrictive cardiomyopathy: Features like diastolic dysfunction, right-sided heart failure, and AV block could fit with a restrictive cardiomyopathy. The multi-valvular involvement is less typical. Depending on the etiology, restrictive cardiomyopathies can have associated liver disease.

3. Cirrhosis with hepatopulmonary syndrome and cirrhotic cardiomyopathy: The patient has clear evidence of advanced liver disease with cirrhosis. Hepatopulmonary syndrome could explain the hypoxia and dyspnea. Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy causes both systolic and diastolic dysfunction and arrhythmias. However, the degree of structural heart disease is not typical.

4. Muscular dystrophy with cardiomyopathy: An underlying muscular dystrophy could explain the skeletal muscle findings (elevated CK, weakness, exercise intolerance). Many muscular dystrophies also cause a dilated cardiomyopathy. The liver involvement is less likely to be explained by a primary muscle disorder though.

5. Cardiac amyloidosis: Amyloid deposition in the heart can lead to a restrictive cardiomyopathy with heart failure, arrhythmias, and multi-valvular abnormalities. Amyloid can also deposit in the liver, causing hepatomegaly and liver dysfunction. The degree of skeletal muscle involvement is less characteristic of amyloidosis.",Neuromuscular diseases
['Desminopathy'],"1. Biventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy: Consistent with the findings of abnormal right and left ventricle morphology, ventricular dysfunction, and arrhythmias. May be associated with thromboembolic events.

2. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC): The right ventricular failure, dilation, and arrhythmias fit this diagnosis. However, the left-sided involvement would be atypical.

3. Myocarditis: Could explain the biventricular dysfunction and arrhythmias. The thromboembolic events would be less typical.

4. Familial cardiomyopathy syndrome: The multi-system involvement with skin findings and nephrolithiasis raises suspicion for an underlying genetic disorder affecting the heart and other organs. Examples include Noonan syndrome, Danon disease, and mitochondrial disorders.

5. Dilated cardiomyopathy with thromboembolism: The dilated atrial septum and ventricular dilation/dysfunction are consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy. If a hypercoagulable state is also present, it could account for the thromboembolic events. However, this would not readily explain the skin and renal findings.",Neuromuscular diseases
['Brugada syndrome'],"1. Acute myocardial infarction (heart attack): Ventricular fibrillation, ST segment elevation, dyspnea, exercise intolerance. A STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) is likely.

2. Pneumonia: Dyspnea, cough, exercise intolerance. Fever and abnormal lung sounds would further support this, though not reported.

3. Viral myocarditis: Ventricular fibrillation, dyspnea, exercise intolerance, ST segment elevation, viral hepatitis. Diffuse ST changes and viral symptoms make myocarditis a possibility.

4. Congestive heart failure: Dyspnea, exercise intolerance, hepatitis (if due to liver congestion). Peripheral edema and chest x-ray findings would support this. The acute arrhythmia makes CHF less likely as the primary issue.

5. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation: Dyspnea, cough, exercise intolerance. While the patient's age is unknown, severe COPD can cause cor pulmonale which could potentially trigger a cardiac event. However, the ST elevation and ventricular fibrillation suggest a primary cardiac etiology.",Uncommon and rare diseases of the heart
['Brugada syndrome'],"1. Brugada syndrome: Consistent with syncope, right bundle branch block, and ST segment elevation. However, the patient did not report palpitations or have documented ventricular arrhythmias.

2. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia: Matches the syncope and loss of consciousness, but the characteristic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia was not seen. Trismus and hyperhidrosis could be atypical manifestations.

3. Myocarditis: Can explain the syncope, vomiting, conduction abnormalities, and ST changes. Missing symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, and fever.

4. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: The right bundle branch block and syncope fit, but the patient lacks other features like epsilon waves, inverted T waves in V1-V3, or ventricular arrhythmias.

5. Congenital long QT syndrome: Syncope and loss of consciousness are typical, but no QT prolongation was reported. Trismus and hyperhidrosis are not usually seen.",Uncommon and rare diseases of the heart
['Brugada syndrome'],"1. Duchenne muscular dystrophy: Explains muscle weakness, elevated CK, exercise intolerance, and can have cardiac involvement leading to the cardiac symptoms. Does not account for prostatitis or urinary symptoms.

2. Acute myocardial infarction with prostatitis: The cardiac symptoms and elevated cardiac enzymes fit with MI. Prostatitis could explain the urinary symptoms. However, MI and prostatitis alone would not account for the neurological symptoms like muscle weakness.

3. Becker muscular dystrophy: Similar to Duchenne but with later onset. Matches the muscle weakness, high CK, exercise intolerance and cardiac involvement. Doesn't explain the prostate/urinary issues.

4. Myocarditis with neurological manifestations: Can present with ST elevation, high CK-MB, syncope and pedal edema. Severe cases may have neurological symptoms. Prostatitis and urinary symptoms still unexplained.

5. Transient ischemic attack (TIA) with urinary tract infection (UTI): TIA could cause the amaurosis fugax, syncope and loss of consciousness. A UTI spreading to the prostate matches the urinary symptoms and prostatitis. Doesn't fully explain the cardiac signs or elevated CK.",Uncommon and rare diseases of the heart
[],"1. Cardiac amyloidosis: The combination of heart failure symptoms (dyspnea, edema), atrial fibrillation, conduction abnormalities, valvular dysfunction, and pericardial effusion is consistent with cardiac amyloid deposition. Systemic symptoms like muscle weakness and GI issues could reflect multi-organ involvement. However, hallmark findings such as low voltage on ECG are not mentioned.

2. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC): This genetic disorder is characterized by fibro-fatty replacement of the right ventricle, leading to arrhythmias, right heart dysfunction, and heart failure. The patient's right atrial and ventricular abnormalities, conduction delay, and ventricular arrhythmias fit this picture. Family history and task force criteria would support the diagnosis.

3. Dilated cardiomyopathy: The patient has evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction and atrial enlargement, which could indicate a dilated cardiomyopathy. This can be genetic or acquired and lead to arrhythmias, valve dysfunction, and heart failure. A family history, exposure history, and evaluation for secondary causes would be important.

4. Restrictive cardiomyopathy: Infiltrative disorders and some storage diseases can cause a stiff heart with restrictive physiology. The patient's atrial enlargement, heart failure symptoms, and pericardial effusion could fit this pattern. Specific findings like enhanced ventricular filling and abnormal tissue characterization on imaging are not described but would support this diagnosis.

5. Tricuspid valve endocarditis: Given the abnormal tricuspid valve, tricuspid regurgitation, and systemic symptoms, infective endocarditis of the tricuspid valve should be considered. The GI symptoms and vascular abnormalities could reflect septic emboli. However, typical findings like fever, positive blood cultures, and vegetations are not reported, making this less likely.",Uncommon and rare diseases of the heart
[],"1. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: The patient's left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, and arrhythmias are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the degree of right-sided heart failure and multi-organ involvement are atypical.

2. Cardiac amyloidosis: This infiltrative cardiomyopathy could explain the patient's biventricular hypertrophy and failure, arrhythmias, and multi-organ dysfunction. Key features not reported include macroglossia and periorbital purpura.

3. Fabry disease: This X-linked lysosomal storage disorder can cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, renal failure, and neuropathy. The patient's constellation of cardiac, renal, and possible neurologic symptoms could fit this diagnosis. Lack of reported angiokeratomas or corneal opacities.

4. Hemochromatosis: Iron overload can lead to restrictive cardiomyopathy, liver dysfunction, and diabetes. The patient's cardiac and hepatic abnormalities could be explained by this, but there is no mention of skin pigmentation or diabetes.

5. Sarcoidosis: This multi-system granulomatous disorder can involve the heart, lungs, liver, and kidneys. Cardiac findings include cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias. Pulmonary and hepatic granulomas could account for some of the patient's other symptoms. Hypercalcemia and elevated ACE levels would support this diagnosis but were not reported.",Rare kidney diseases
[],"1. Congestive heart failure: The patient has clear signs of advanced heart failure, including reduced ejection fraction, valve abnormalities, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, and liver congestion. However, the underlying cause of the heart failure is unclear.

2. Restrictive cardiomyopathy: The constellation of right and left heart failure, valve abnormalities, atrial fibrillation, and systemic congestion could fit with a restrictive cardiomyopathy, which is often caused by infiltrative disorders like amyloidosis or sarcoidosis.

3. Multiple sclerosis: The combination of upper motor neuron signs and a possible peripheral neuropathy could fit with MS. However, classic MS symptoms like vision problems, sensory changes, and fatigue were not mentioned. MRI brain and spine would be helpful to look for characteristic lesions.

4. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS): The mix of upper and lower motor neuron findings fits with ALS. However, the patient's young age (assuming based on no age provided) and lack of clear lower motor neuron signs like muscle atrophy and fasciculations make this less likely. EMG/NCS of multiple limbs and bulbar region would help evaluate for ALS.

5.

2. Cervical spondylotic myelopathy: The cervical spinal canal stenosis and intervertebral disk abnormalities could be compressing the spinal cord, leading to myelopathy. This could explain the upper limb weakness and neuropathic EMG findings. Slurred speech would be atypical but could occur with advanced cervical cord compression.

4. Diuretic abuse: Chronic diuretic use can cause hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and disrupted calcium handling. Obtain medication history and screen for diuretics if suspected. Hypocalciuria is atypical.

5. Conn's syndrome (primary hyperaldosteronism): Excess aldosterone causes hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and sometimes hypocalciuria. Usually also presents with hypertension, which was not reported in this patient.",Rare kidney diseases
['Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria'],"1. Myelodysplastic syndrome: Pancytopenia, megaloblastic anemia, abnormal cell morphology. Does not explain the kidney, liver or GI issues well.

2. Aplastic anemia: Pancytopenia, reticulocytosis, weakness. Usually would not cause megaloblastic changes, proteinuria, or liver issues.

3. Vitamin B12 deficiency: Megaloblastic anemia, pancytopenia, neurological symptoms. The severe neutropenia and proteinuria are atypical.  

4. Autoimmune disorder (e.g. SLE): Pancytopenia, proteinuria, urticaria, liver inflammation, hypercoagulability. The megaloblastic anemia is not a classic finding.

5. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria: Pancytopenia, hypercoagulability, hemolysis, kidney dysfunction. Thrombocytopenia and megaloblastic anemia are less common.",Rare haematological diseases
['Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria'],"1. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia: The patient has anemia, jaundice, increased bilirubin, and reticulocytosis consistent with a hemolytic process. Fever and elevated ESR suggest an underlying inflammatory condition. However, the aplastic anemia and other organ involvement make a primary autoimmune hemolytic anemia less likely.

2. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH): PNH can cause hemolytic anemia, bone marrow failure (aplastic anemia), and thrombosis leading to organ dysfunction. The patient's dark urine, abdominal pain, and kidney abnormalities could fit. Missing symptoms include the classic dark urine in the morning and thrombotic events.

3. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): TTP causes microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, fever, neurological symptoms, and kidney failure. Many of the patient's symptoms align, but key missing features are thrombocytopenia and schistocytes on peripheral smear.

4. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): SLE is a multisystem autoimmune disorder that can present with hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, liver inflammation, kidney disease, serositis (pleural effusion), fever, and weight changes. The patient has symptoms spanning many of these organ systems. Additional testing for SLE-specific antibodies would be helpful.

5. Multiple myeloma: The patient's anemia, kidney dysfunction, hypercalcemia, and elevated ESR could suggest multiple myeloma. However, the patient is missing key features like bone pain and elevated total protein. Serum/urine protein electrophoresis and bone marrow biopsy would help rule this out.",Rare haematological diseases
['Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria'],"1. Myelofibrosis: The patient's anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, increased megakaryocytes, hepatosplenomegaly, and myelofibrosis are highly consistent with this bone marrow disorder. However, the PNH-like findings (decreased GPI-anchored proteins) are atypical.

2. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH): The reduced granulocyte CD55/CD59 and GPI-anchored protein levels, anemia, reticulocytosis, and abnormal urine color fit with PNH. But the degree of organomegaly and myelofibrosis are unusual.

3. Gaucher disease: This lysosomal storage disorder can cause hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, skeletal abnormalities, and sometimes PNH-like features. However, the myelofibrosis and megakaryocyte findings are not typical.

4. Extramedullary hematopoiesis due to liver cirrhosis: Severe liver disease can lead to portal hypertension and splenic extramedullary hematopoiesis, potentially explaining the organomegaly, ascites, cytopenias, and bone marrow findings. The PNH-like features are still unusual though.

5. Bone marrow failure syndrome (e.g. aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome): These disorders can cause pancytopenia, bone marrow hypocellularity or fibrosis, and compensatory extramedullary hematopoiesis. PNH clones sometimes arise in these conditions. However, the degree of liver involvement here would be atypical.",Rare haematological diseases
['Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria'],"1. Myelodysplastic syndrome: pancytopenia, myelodysplasia, abnormal cell morphology, and reticulocytosis are all consistent. MDS is a group of disorders where the bone marrow fails to produce enough healthy blood cells. Additional genetic studies could help classify the specific subtype.

2. Aplastic anemia: the pancytopenia and compensatory reticulocytosis fit. Aplastic anemia occurs when the bone marrow stops producing enough new blood cells, often due to autoimmune attack or certain medications or toxins. A bone marrow biopsy would show characteristic findings.

3. Acute myeloid leukemia: pancytopenia, abnormal cell morphology, and myelodysplasia could indicate AML, where immature white blood cells crowd out normal blood production in the marrow. Lack of circulating immature white blood cells (blasts) argues against this, but a bone marrow biopsy should be definitive.  

4. Systemic lupus erythematosus: the combination of oral ulcers, rash, fever, and pancytopenia due to lupus-associated bone marrow suppression is a possibility. Lupus can cause inflammation and autoimmune attack in multiple organs. A positive ANA and dsDNA would support this diagnosis.

5. Inherited bone marrow failure syndrome (e.g. Fanconi anemia, dyskeratosis congenita): these rare genetic conditions can cause pancytopenia, myelodysplasia, and physical anomalies. The lack of reported congenital defects makes this less likely, but specific genetic testing may be warranted if other diagnoses are excluded.",Rare haematological diseases
['Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria'],"1. Myelofibrosis: Pancytopenia, hepatomegaly, portal hypertension, systemic symptoms, and abnormal blood cell morphology can occur. A bone marrow biopsy would show fibrosis.

2. Disseminated tuberculosis: Can cause pancytopenia, hepatomegaly, ascites, fever, and diffuse symptoms. Hemophagocytosis sometimes occurs. A positive TB test and imaging findings would support this.

3. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia: Anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, abnormal RBC morphology, and hemophagocytosis can be seen. Coombs test would be positive. Hepatomegaly and ascites are atypical.

4. Acute leukemia: The abnormal blood counts and cell morphology, fever, and systemic symptoms could fit. Hepatomegaly and coagulopathy sometimes occur. Peripheral smear and bone marrow findings would be diagnostic.

5. Cirrhosis with portal hypertension: Explains the liver findings, ascites, and varices. Pancytopenia can occur from splenic sequestration. However, this would not account for all the hematologic and systemic abnormalities.",Rare haematological diseases
['POEMS syndrome'],"1. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): The multi-organ involvement (heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, blood), serositis, and hematologic abnormalities are all consistent with SLE. Lupus can also cause endocrine issues and increase risk of infections.

2. Autoimmune hepatitis: The liver dysfunction with hepatomegaly, ascites, and edema could be from autoimmune hepatitis. This condition often co-occurs with other autoimmune diseases like thyroiditis. It would not fully explain the cardiac findings though.

3. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS): The enlarged ovaries with cysts and ascites raise suspicion for OHSS. However, this is usually seen in the context of fertility treatments and would not account for many of the other systemic findings.

4. Amyloidosis: While rare, amyloidosis can cause multi-organ dysfunction including heart failure, hepatomegaly, nephrotic syndrome, and endocrine abnormalities. The lack of classic symptoms like macroglossia and periorbital purpura makes this less likely.

5. Severe malnutrition with re-feeding syndrome: The patient's hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia, anemia, and weight loss could potentially reflect severe malnutrition. Re-feeding syndrome can then cause fluid shifts and heart failure. However, this would not explain the degree of multi-organ involvement seen.",Rare neurological diseases
['POEMS syndrome'],"1. Hemochromatosis: The combination of cirrhosis, diabetes, hypogonadism, and cardiomyopathy can be seen in advanced cases. However, the patient is lacking other key features like skin pigmentation and arthropathy.

2. Wilson disease: Cirrhosis, neurological symptoms, anemia, and psychiatric disturbances fit, but the patient is missing Kayser-Fleischer rings and other classic neurological findings. Serum ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urine copper would be helpful tests.

3. Multiple myeloma: The anemia, elevated IgG, hypercalcemia, renal dysfunction, and bone lesions are consistent. The neurological symptoms could be explained by hyperviscosity or amyloidosis. Skeletal survey and bone marrow biopsy would be diagnostic.

4. Lymphoma: Lymphadenopathy, fevers, weight loss, anemia, and elevated IgG may indicate lymphoma with liver and CNS involvement. The neurological findings could be due to CNS lymphoma or a paraneoplastic syndrome. Lymph node and bone marrow biopsy are needed.

5. Tuberculosis: Disseminated TB can cause lymphadenopathy, liver disease, CNS involvement, and constitutional symptoms. The patient lacks pulmonary findings but could have extrapulmonary TB. Chest imaging, lymph node biopsy, and TB cultures would be key tests.",Rare neurological diseases
['POEMS syndrome'],"1. POEMS syndrome: The constellation of Polyneuropathy, Organomegaly (splenomegaly), Endocrinopathy (not reported but could be subclinical), Monoclonal protein (increased IgA), and Skin changes (not reported) fits well. Other consistent findings include thrombocytosis, pulmonary hypertension, and abnormal bone morphology.

2. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP): The patient has demyelinating motor and sensory neuropathy, which could be due to CIDP. This would not explain the organomegaly or hematologic abnormalities.

3. Familial amyloid polyneuropathy: Amyloidosis can cause demyelinating neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, hepatomegaly, and autonomic dysfunction (not reported here). The thrombocytosis and increased IgA would be atypical.

4. Myeloproliferative neoplasm (e.g. polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia): The thrombocytosis and splenomegaly suggest a myeloproliferative disorder. These are sometimes associated with secondary neuropathy, but the demyelinating features would be unusual. The cardiovascular complications could be related.

5. Vitamin B12 deficiency: Severe B12 deficiency can cause demyelinating neuropathy, cognitive changes (not reported), and megaloblastic anemia with associated thrombocytosis. It would not explain the organomegaly or other abnormalities.",Rare neurological diseases
['POEMS syndrome'],"1. Systemic lupus erythematosus: The patient's proteinuria, hematuria, abnormal renal morphology, thrombocytosis, elevated IgA, serositis (pleural and pericardial effusions), lymphadenopathy, and multi-organ involvement could fit with lupus. However, some characteristic symptoms like malar rash and arthritis were not mentioned.

2. IgA nephropathy (Berger's disease): The patient's hematuria, proteinuria, abnormal renal morphology, elevated IgA levels, and GI symptoms could match IgA nephropathy. A renal biopsy would be needed for definitive diagnosis.

3. Sarcoidosis: The multi-organ involvement including abnormal adrenal morphology, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, skin changes, and elevated ESR could suggest sarcoidosis. Hypercalcemia and lung involvement are common features that were not reported here.

4. ANCA-associated vasculitis (e.g., granulomatosis with polyangiitis): The combination of renal disease, neuropathy, GI inflammation, and constitutional symptoms could fit with a systemic vasculitis. ANCA testing and tissue biopsies would be key for diagnosis.

5. Amyloidosis: While less likely, the multi-organ dysfunction, proteinuria, cardiac abnormalities, GI symptoms, and neuropathy could be explained by systemic amyloidosis. Tissue biopsy with Congo red staining would be required.",Rare neurological diseases
['POEMS syndrome'],"1. AL amyloidosis: The patient has multiple organ systems affected including cardiac, renal, gastrointestinal, and possibly nervous system involvement. The presence of a monoclonal IgA protein strongly suggests an underlying plasma cell dyscrasia leading to AL amyloidosis.

2. Sarcoidosis: The patient's presentation with pulmonary hypertension, lymphadenopathy, eye findings, and multi-organ inflammation could fit with sarcoidosis. Hypercalcemia was not mentioned but would further support this diagnosis.

3. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): SLE can cause a similar multi-system presentation with kidney, heart, lung, hematologic, and joint involvement. Specific symptoms like malar rash, oral ulcers, and serositis were not mentioned but anti-dsDNA and anti-Smith antibodies could help establish the diagnosis.

4. Lymphoma: Diffuse lymphadenopathy, constitutional symptoms, and monoclonal protein raise suspicion for an underlying lymphoma. The patient's anemia and other cytopenias could be related. A lymph node or bone marrow biopsy would be diagnostic.

5. Multiple myeloma: The patient's hyperuricemia, kidney dysfunction, anemia, and monoclonal protein are all consistent with multiple myeloma. However, the degree of cardiac and pulmonary involvement would be unusual. Serum/urine protein electrophoresis and bone marrow biopsy are needed.",Rare neurological diseases

"['Chronic visceral acid sphingomyelinase deficiency', 'Niemann-Pick disease type C']","1. Niemann-Pick disease: This lysosomal storage disorder can cause progressive neurological deterioration, splenomegaly, and lung involvement. The patient's neurological symptoms, splenomegaly, and abnormal lung morphology fit this diagnosis. However, inguinal hernia and trismus are not typical.

2. Mucopolysaccharidosis: These disorders involve defective breakdown of glycosaminoglycans, leading to progressive multisystem dysfunction. The combination of neurological, skeletal (talipes), and possible airway (trismus) abnormalities could fit, but splenomegaly is less common.

3. Gaucher disease: Another lysosomal storage disorder characterized by splenomegaly, skeletal abnormalities, and variable neurological involvement. This could explain many of the patient's symptoms, though lung and airway issues are not classic for Gaucher disease.

4. Leukodystrophy (e.g. metachromatic leukodystrophy, Krabbe disease): The abnormal cerebral white matter, progressive neurological symptoms, and multisystem involvement could fit with a leukodystrophy. Additional testing would be needed to identify the specific type.

5. Mitochondrial disorder: Mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to a wide range of neurological, muscular, and multisystem issues. The patient's constellation of symptoms could be explained by a mitochondrial disorder, though the specific findings of splenomegaly and abnormal lung morphology are less common.",Hereditary metabolic disorders
