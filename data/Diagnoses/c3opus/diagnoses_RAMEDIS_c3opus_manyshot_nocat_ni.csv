Methylmalonic acidemia: The patient's decreased methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity, metabolic acidosis, and early death are highly consistent with this inherited metabolic disorder. Key features not mentioned include elevated methylmalonic acid levels, developmental delay, and kidney problems.

Patients may still present with metabolic acidosis and complications, but death in infancy would be less common than in classic methylmalonic acidemia.

3. Methylmalonic acidemia: Another organic acidemia with similar presentation to propionic acidemia. Elevated methylmalonic acid in urine would be expected.

4. Isovaleric acidemia: Can cause lethargy, odor, and neurological symptoms in infancy. Isovalerylglycine in urine is a key finding.

5. Glutaric acidemia type 1: Presents with hypotonia, dystonia, and encephalopathic crises. Elevated glutaric acid and 3-hydroxyglutaric acid in urine are diagnostic.",Hereditary metabolic disorders
['Phenylketonuria'],"Based on the provided information, the top 5 potential diagnoses are:

1. Tyrosinemia type 1: The patient's hypertyrosinemia, hypotonia, premature birth, and death in infancy fit with this amino acid disorder. Other symptoms can include liver dysfunction and renal tubular dysfunction.

2. Phenylketonuria (PKU): The patient's hyperphenylalaninemia raises suspicion for PKU, which can cause intellectual disability, seizures, and eczema if untreated. Death in childhood would be atypical.

3. Zellweger spectrum disorder: This peroxisomal biogenesis disorder can cause hypotonia, intellectual disability, vision/hearing impairment, and liver dysfunction. Survival beyond infancy is variable.  

4. Congenital disorder of glycosylation: CDGs are a large group of disorders that can cause a wide range of symptoms including hypotonia, failure to thrive, intellectual disability, and multiple organ dysfunction. Survival is variable depending on the subtype.

['Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome'],"1. Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome: The patient's facial features, limb anomalies, developmental delays, behavioral issues, and elevated 7-dehydrocholesterol are all consistent with this disorder of cholesterol biosynthesis. The severe phenotype with infant and childhood mortality suggests a more severe form of SLOS.

2. Peroxisome biogenesis disorder: Some features like intellectual disability, hearing loss, and early death could fit, but this would not explain the elevated 7-dehydrocholesterol. Patients with peroxisomal disorders often have neurological regression and liver dysfunction, which were not reported here.

3. Oral-facial-digital syndrome: The facial features, intellectual disability and limb anomalies could suggest a ciliopathy, but oral-facial-digital syndromes are not typically associated with abnormal sterols or such a severe, lethal phenotype. Polycystic kidneys and other organ involvement would be expected.  

4. CHARGE syndrome: CHARGE could explain some of the facial features, intellectual disability, and limb anomalies, but coloboma, choanal atresia, and genital hypoplasia are cardinal features that were not noted here. It also would not account for the abnormal cholesterol metabolism.

5. Alagille syndrome: The facial dysmorphisms, developmental delays and early mortality could suggest Alagille syndrome, but defining features like bile duct paucity, cholestasis, congenital heart disease and vertebral anomalies are lacking. The sterol abnormalities also point away from this diagnosis.",Hereditary metabolic disorders
['Vitamin B12-unresponsive methylmalonic acidemia'],"1. Methylmalonic acidemia: The patient's microcephaly, developmental delays, failure to thrive, metabolic acidosis, hyperammonemia, elevated methylmalonic acid, and decreased methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity are all consistent with this diagnosis. The multi-organ involvement and childhood deaths further support a severe form of methylmalonic acidemia.

2. Propionic acidemia: Another organic acidemia that can present similarly to methylmalonic acidemia in the neonatal period with poor feeding, hypotonia, developmental delays, metabolic acidosis, hyperammonemia, and multi-organ dysfunction. However, the patient's methylmalonic acidemia and enzyme findings make this less likely.

3. Mitochondrial disorder: The patient's brain involvement, hypotonia, elevated lactate, and multi-system disease could fit with a mitochondrial disorder. However, the specific metabolic and enzymatic profile is more suggestive of methylmalonic acidemia.

4. Urea cycle disorder: The patient's hyperammonemia, encephalopathy, and metabolic abnormalities could represent a urea cycle disorder, but these typically do not cause elevated methylmalonic acid or acidosis.

5. Cobalamin deficiency: Nutritional vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency can cause methylmalonic acidemia and a similar clinical picture, but the patient's decreased methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity points to an inherent enzymatic defect rather than a nutritional deficiency.",Hereditary metabolic disorders

Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD): The patient's seizures, spastic paralysis, motor delay, hypotonia, metabolic acidosis, feeding difficulties, and death in infancy, along with the findings of hypervalinemia, hyperleucinemia, hyperisoleucinemia, and characteristic body odor, are all consistent with this inborn error of branched-chain amino acid metabolism.

2. Propionic acidemia: This disorder of propionate metabolism can present in the neonatal period with poor feeding, hypotonia, seizures, and metabolic acidosis. However, the absence of the characteristic amino acid profile and odor makes this less likely than MSUD.

3. Methylmalonic acidemia: Another organic acidemia that can cause neurological deterioration, metabolic acidosis, and death in infancy. As with propionic acidemia, the patient's amino acid abnormalities and maple syrup odor are more suggestive of MSUD.

4. Urea cycle disorders: Defects in the urea cycle can present with hyperammonemia, encephalopathy, respiratory alkalosis, and early death. However, these usually spare branched-chain amino acid metabolism.

5. Leigh syndrome: This progressive neurometabolic disorder is characterized by psychomotor regression, hypotonia, ataxia, and lactic acidosis due to mitochondrial dysfunction. The absence of lactic acidosis and presence of amino acid abnormalities make Leigh syndrome unlikely in this case.",Hereditary metabolic disorders

Death in childhood is consistent with the condition's poor prognosis.

2. Glutaric aciduria type 1: While this disorder can present with intellectual disability, seizures, and dyskinesia, the specific finding of L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria points away from this diagnosis.

3. Canavan disease: This leukodystrophy can have overlapping symptoms of intellectual disability, seizures, and early death, but ataxia and tremor are not typical, and L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria is not seen.

4. Unverricht-Lundborg disease: This progressive myoclonus epilepsy presents with seizures, ataxia, and tremor, but intellectual disability is not a core feature, and it does not explain the metabolic abnormality.
