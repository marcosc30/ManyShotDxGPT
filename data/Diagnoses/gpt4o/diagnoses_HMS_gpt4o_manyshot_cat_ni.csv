a. Key symptoms that stand out include: sinusitis, hypertension, goiter, mitral regurgitation, exertional dyspnea, generalized muscle weakness, antinuclear antibody positivity, elevated circulating C-reactive protein concentration, ground-glass opacification, and abnormal CD4:CD8 ratio.

- Chest CT scan to further evaluate the ground-glass opacification.
- Echocardiogram to assess the severity of mitral regurgitation and any other cardiac abnormalities.
