a. Key symptoms that stand out include microcephaly, low-set ears, wide nasal bridge, strabismus, delayed speech and language development, syndactyly, intellectual disability, motor delay, severe short stature, and severe hearing impairment. Additionally, the presence of elevated 8-dehydrocholesterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol concentrations are significant biochemical findings.

b. Possible diagnoses:
1. Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome (SLOS): This condition is characterized by microcephaly, intellectual disability, syndactyly, and elevated levels of 7-dehydrocholesterol. The presence of elevated 8-dehydrocholesterol further supports this diagnosis.
2. Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS): This syndrome can present with microcephaly, low-set ears, wide nasal bridge, strabismus, intellectual disability, and severe short stature. However, the biochemical findings are not typical for CdLS.
3. Trisomy 13 (Patau Syndrome): This condition can present with microcephaly, low-set ears, wide nasal bridge, strabismus, severe intellectual disability, and severe short stature. However, the biochemical findings are not typical for Trisomy 13.

5. Meckel-Gruber Syndrome: This syndrome can present with microcephaly, low-set ears, wide nasal bridge, severe intellectual disability, and neonatal death. However, the biochemical findings are not typical for this condition.

c.

['Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency'],"<thinking>
a. Key symptoms that stand out include 'Delayed speech and language development', 'Abnormality of prenatal development or birth', 'Death in infancy', 'Neonatal death', 'Death in childhood', 'Decreased plasma free carnitine', and 'Decreased 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase level'. The combination of these symptoms suggests a metabolic disorder, particularly one affecting fatty acid oxidation.

b. Possible diagnoses:
1. Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD): This condition is characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme needed to break down medium-chain fatty acids. Symptoms can include hypoglycemia, lethargy, and sudden death, which align with the patient's history of neonatal and childhood death.
2. Long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (LCHADD): This disorder involves a deficiency in the enzyme needed to break down long-chain fatty acids. Symptoms include hypoglycemia, muscle weakness, and cardiomyopathy, which could explain the patient's decreased 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase level.
3. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency (CPT II deficiency): This condition affects the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for oxidation. Symptoms can include muscle pain, weakness, and episodes of rhabdomyolysis, which might be consistent with the decreased plasma free carnitine.
4. Trifunctional protein deficiency: This disorder affects the breakdown of long-chain fatty acids and can present with hypoglycemia, cardiomyopathy, and muscle weakness. The decreased 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase level is a key indicator.
5. Multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD): This condition involves a defect in the electron transfer flavoprotein or its dehydrogenase, affecting multiple steps in fatty acid oxidation. Symptoms can include hypoglycemia, muscle weakness, and metabolic acidosis.

c. Additional tests that could help narrow down the diagnosis include genetic testing for specific enzyme deficiencies, acylcarnitine profile analysis, and muscle biopsy to assess for lipid storage myopathy.

b. Possible diagnoses:
1. Mitochondrial disorders: The combination of increased lactate, pyruvate, hypotonia, and multi-organ involvement (kidney, heart, pancreas) suggests a mitochondrial disorder.
2. Organic acidemias: The presence of 3-methylglutaric aciduria and elevated urinary 3-hydroxybutyric acid points towards an organic acidemia.
3. Congenital disorders of glycosylation: Symptoms like hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and multi-organ involvement could indicate a congenital disorder of glycosylation.
4. Fanconi syndrome: The presence of renal Fanconi syndrome, hypoglycemia, and chronic kidney disease suggests this diagnosis.
5. Metabolic disorders: The broad range of symptoms, including hypoglycemia, increased lactate, and pyruvate, suggests a metabolic disorder.

- Genetic testing to identify specific mutations.
- Metabolic panel to further analyze organic acids, amino acids, and carnitine levels.
- Imaging studies to assess organ involvement.
- Biopsy of affected tissues (e.g., muscle biopsy for mitochondrial disorders).
