['Phenylketonuria'],"+1. Phenylketonuria (PKU): Hyperphenylalaninemia, abnormal circulating tyrosine concentration, potential neonatal/early death are consistent with this disorder caused by phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency.

+2. Atypical phenylketonuria: A milder variant of PKU with partial phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency, could explain the hyperphenylalaninemia and abnormal tyrosine levels.

+3. Non-PKU hyperphenylalaninemia: Other defects in enzymes involved in phenylalanine metabolism can also lead to elevated phenylalanine levels.

+4. Biopterin cofactor biosynthesis defects: Impaired recycling of the biopterin cofactor required for phenylalanine hydroxylase activity can cause hyperphenylalaninemia.

+5. Tyrosinemia type II: A defect in the tyrosine aminotransferase enzyme could explain the abnormal circulating tyrosine concentration, though hyperphenylalaninemia is not a typical feature.",Hereditary metabolic disorders
[],"+1. Methylmalonic acidemia: Cyanosis, seizures, hyperammonemia, and neonatal death are consistent with this disorder. The presence of 3-hydroxydicarboxylic aciduria is a key finding.

+2. Propionic acidemia: The symptoms of cyanosis, seizures, hyperammonemia, and neonatal death are also seen in this disorder. The 3-hydroxydicarboxylic aciduria may be present due to the accumulation of metabolites.

+3. Isovaleric acidemia: Cyanosis, seizures, and hyperammonemia are common features of this disorder. However, the presence of 3-hydroxydicarboxylic aciduria is not a typical finding.

+4. Glutaric acidemia type II: This disorder can present with seizures, hyperammonemia, and potentially fatal metabolic crises. However, cyanosis is not a common feature, and the presence of 3-hydroxydicarboxylic aciduria is not typical.

+5. Recurrent metabolic encephalomyopathic crises-rhabdomyolysis-cardiac arrhythmia-intellectual disability syndrome: While this disorder can present with seizures, hyperammonemia, and metabolic crises, the symptoms of cyanosis, neonatal death, and 3-hydroxydicarboxylic aciduria are not typical features.",Hereditary metabolic disorders
