+4. Chromosomal deletion or duplication syndrome: The combination of craniofacial dysmorphisms, intellectual disability, and congenital malformations could potentially be explained by a chromosomal imbalance. Specific features may vary depending on the chromosomal region involved.

+5. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD): While not a perfect fit, some of the craniofacial features (smooth philtrum, thin vermilion border of the lips), intellectual disability, and congenital malformations could be consistent with prenatal alcohol exposure.
