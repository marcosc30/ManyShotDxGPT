['Alkaptonuria'],"+1. Urea cycle disorder: Consistent with vomiting, dark urine (due to elevated ammonia levels), and potential for death in infancy if untreated. Key symptoms not reported: neurological symptoms, hyperammonemia.

+2. Organic acidemia: Consistent with vomiting, dark urine (due to the presence of organic acids), and potential for death in infancy if untreated. Key symptoms not reported: metabolic acidosis, ketosis, developmental delay.
