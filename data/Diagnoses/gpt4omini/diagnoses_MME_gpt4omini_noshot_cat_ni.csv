+2 Aplastic Anemia: Neutropenia, lymphopenia, intermittent thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly. Key symptoms not reported: Severe fatigue, pallor, or bleeding tendencies. 
+3 Hyper-IgE Syndrome: Recurrent infections, gingivitis, splenomegaly. Key symptoms not reported: Eczematous skin lesions, elevated IgE levels. 
+4 Common Variable Immunodeficiency: Recurrent infections, splenomegaly, neutropenia, lymphopenia. Key symptoms not reported: History of autoimmune diseases or gastrointestinal issues. 
+5 Bone Marrow Disorders (e.g., Myelodysplastic Syndromes): Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, granulocytic hyperplasia. Key symptoms not reported: Anemia or abnormal blood cell morphology.",Rare immunodeficiency
['Combined immunodeficiency-enteropathy spectrum'],"+1 Congenital gastrointestinal malformations: This diagnosis is consistent with all reported symptoms (omphalocele, intestinal obstruction, intestinal atresia). Key symptoms not reported may include other associated congenital anomalies.
+2 Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome: This condition aligns with the omphalocele symptom. Key symptoms not reported include macroglossia and organomegaly.
+3 Meconium ileus: This could explain the intestinal obstruction, but does not account for the omphalocele. Key symptoms not reported include signs of cystic fibrosis.
+4 VACTERL association: This could explain the intestinal atresia and obstruction, but does not specifically account for the omphalocele. Key symptoms not reported include other anomalies such as vertebral defects or cardiac issues.
+5 Gastroschisis: This is ruled out due to the presence of an omphalocele, but it is worth noting as a differential diagnosis for intestinal obstruction. Key symptoms not reported include the absence of a protective sac around the intestines.",Rare immunodeficiency
['Alacrimia-choreoathetosis-liver dysfunction syndrome'],"+1 Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation: This condition can present with microcephaly, hypotonia, developmental delays, and hepatic involvement. The patient's symptoms of hepatic fibrosis and elevated transaminases align with this diagnosis. Key symptoms not reported may include seizures or feeding difficulties.
+2 Mitochondrial Myopathy: The increased lactate levels and neurological symptoms suggest a mitochondrial disorder. This condition can cause hypotonia, developmental delays, and strabismus. Symptoms not reported may include muscle weakness or exercise intolerance.
+3 Joubert Syndrome: Characterized by cerebellar ataxia, hypotonia, and developmental delays, this syndrome also presents with brain malformations such as hypoplasia of the corpus callosum. The patient's symptoms of microcephaly and abnormal movement are consistent. Symptoms not reported may include eye movement abnormalities or kidney issues.
+4 Meckel-Gruber Syndrome: This genetic disorder can present with microcephaly, hepatic fibrosis, and developmental delays. The combination of symptoms aligns well, particularly with the presence of renal anomalies, which were not reported in this case.
+5 Bardet-Biedl Syndrome: This syndrome includes symptoms such as strabismus, developmental delays, and hypotonia, along with potential renal and hepatic involvement. The patient's symptoms of alacrima and chalazion may also fit. Symptoms not reported may include obesity or polydactyly.",Rare neurological diseases
